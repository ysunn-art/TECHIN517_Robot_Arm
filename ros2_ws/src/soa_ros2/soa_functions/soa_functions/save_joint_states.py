"""Save joint states service node.

Provides the /follower/save_joint_states service (soa_interfaces/srv/SaveJointStates)
to capture the current joint states of the follower arm and optionally append them
to a CSV file for later analysis or replay.

The joint state positions are recorded with column headers derived from the joint
names in the JointState message.

Can be run standalone without a namespace argument:
    ros2 run soa_functions save_joint_states

Services:
    /follower/save_joint_states (soa_interfaces/srv/SaveJointStates)
        request:  csv_path — path to CSV file; if empty, joint states are not saved
        response: success, joint_states

Subscriptions:
    /follower/joint_states (sensor_msgs/JointState)
